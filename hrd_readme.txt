ssh to simons playground
use start_wrapper.py and an excel file that holds paths to svs files (similar to the "example_hrd.xlsx" file in this repo)

example start command: /home/simon/anaconda3/envs/py39/bin/python start_wrapper.py -c "/home/simon/philipp/docker/example_hrd.xlsx"


results are stored to UUIDv4 folders next to the "data" folder of the corresponding file directory
